Execute the following commands after creating the directory and file
NB: Remember to update the steps you took

ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
sudo chmod 555 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 
ls -la /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 


Solution
I used "pwd" command to to ensure i was in my Linux directory
I created a directory called "tmp" using the mkdir commands
I cd into the "tmp" directory using the cd command and created a file xfusioncorp.sh using the touch command
I used the la -la command to make sure the file xfusioncorp.sh was created in the directory
I used la -la command again to verify the permission for the xfusioncorp.sh file
I used sudo chmod 555 command to give read and execute permissions to owner, group and others.
I used the la -la command to ensure the permissions reflected
